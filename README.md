# Eleganté Restaurant

**Eleganté** is a restaurant website. The goal of the website is to create a simple, accessible online space that gathers all relevant information for local businesses that wish to have an online presence without too much maintenance effort. The site features basic information like address, opening hours, social media links and includes a form for reservations.

## Design

Eleganté is a refined, modern Italian restaurant. It mixes the tradition with the energy of its young chefs. A special color palette translates these concepts, and maintain consistence throughout the website.

## Features

**Navigation Bar**

Features quick access to all the relevant information on the page (Home, Location and Book Now). It answers the question, "What do I want to know about this restaurant?"

**Landing Page Image**

This section shows the client with an image of the welcoming environment of the restaurant. This way they know what to expect of the place, how to find it on the street and the description tells them what type of food they mind find. The combination of image and text tells the client what to expect of this restaurant.

**Location**

This section provides useful information such as the address and opening hours, and displays the location on google maps for easy access. There is also an image of a young chef that contrasts with the first, more traditional image adding to the restaurant narrative.

**Reservation**

The goal of this section is to provide an easy, accessible way for clients to make bookings using the form. They can choose the date and time.

## Features Left to Implement

This project was made for the Code Institute course and as a MVP. If it were to be expanded, two other features would come next: A section for "About" to tell more the client about the restaurant, and a section for a "Menu" or special dishes. 

## Testing 

The website was tested with both the W3 HTML Checker and the CSS Jigsaw. The HTML showed improper use of the aria-label tag, which I fixed by adding the role="img" to the div. The CSS passed without errors. 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
